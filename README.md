This project is an example of reading data from Android sensors.

For simplicity, I don't use view models, fragments, DI, etc. and I have each code example in a separate activity. So please look at this project not as a real project, but rather as a couple of samples.

In a real project, consider optimizing your code to suit your application's architecture.
